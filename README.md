# wpa_supplicant for UDM-SE

You will need to install Podman first by unziping the contents of https://github.com/boostchicken-dev/udm-utilities/suites/4551796675/artifacts/122216505 into your root directory on your UDM-SE. 

## overview
This guide has primarily been written for authenticating to AT&T Fiber using wpa_supplicant on a UDM-SE.  It is assumed that you've already retrieved your certificates from a modem supplied by AT&T.  If you have not, you can purchase a used modem on ebay, such as the NVG589 and then root it to get the certificates.  

Before moving on to the next section, make sure you've copied your root certificate into the CA_*.pem file per the instructions of the 802.1x Credential Extraction Tool (mfg_dat_decode).

## running the docker image
1.  scp your certs and wpa_supplicant.conf to the UDM Pro

```
scp -r *.pem root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
root@192.168.1.1's password:
CA_001E46-xxxx.pem                                                          100% 3926     3.8KB/s   00:00
Client_001E46-xxxx.pem                                                      100% 1119     1.1KB/s   00:00
PrivateKey_PKCS1_001E46-xxxx.pem                                            100%  887     0.9KB/s   00:00

scp -r wpa_supplicant.conf root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
wpa_supplicant.conf                                                         100%  680     0.7KB/s   00:00
```

2. ssh to the UDM-SE, create a directory for the certs and wpa_supplicant.conf in the data directory then copy the files over.

```
mkdir /mnt/data/wpa_supplicant/
cp -arfv /tmp/*pem /tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf /mnt/data/wpa_supplicant/
```

3. Update the wpa_supplicant.conf to reflect the correct paths for our container.  **Do not run these more than once or you will end up with incorrect paths.**

```
sed -i 's,ca_cert=",ca_cert="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/,g' /mnt/data/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
sed -i 's,client_cert=",client_cert="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/,g' /mnt/data/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
sed -i 's,private_key=",private_key="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/,g' /mnt/data/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

After running the sed commands, verify your paths in wpa_supplicant.conf look something like this:
```
# cat wpa_supplicant.conf

        ca_cert="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/CA_001E46-xxxxxxxx.pem"
        client_cert="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/Client_001E46-xxxxxx.pem"
        eap=TLS
        eapol_flags=0
        identity="10:05:B1:xx:xx:xx" # Internet (ONT) interface MAC address must match this value
        key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
        phase1="allow_canned_success=1"
        private_key="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/PrivateKey_PKCS1_001E46-xxxxxx.pem"
}
# WARNING! Missing AAA server root CA! Add AAA server root CA to CA_001E46-xxxxxx.pem
#
```

4. Pull the image while you have an internet connection on the UDM-SE.  This step is optional if you plan on running step 5 while you have an internet connection.

```
podman pull pbrah/wpa_supplicant-udmpro:v1.0
```

5. Run the wpa_supplicant podman container, the podman run command below assumes you are using port 10 (SFP) or eth9 for your wan.  If not, adjust accordingly.

```
podman run --privileged --network=host --name=wpa_supplicant-udmpro -v /mnt/data/wpa_supplicant/:/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/ --log-driver=json-file --restart unless-stopped -d -ti pbrah/wpa_supplicant-udmpro:v1.0 -Dwired -ieth9 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

## Finishing Up
Lastly, you need to install the boot script to ensure your UDM-SE autostarts wpa_supplicant on reboot:

curl -fsL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities/HEAD/on-boot-script/remote_install.sh" | /bin/sh

Copy this boot script for wpa_supplicant to /mnt/data/on_boot.d
https://github.com/boostchicken-dev/udm-utilities/blob/master/on-boot-script/examples/udm-files/on_boot.d/10-wpa_supplicant.sh

This will ensure that upon reboot, your UDM-SE autostarts WPA_Supplicant.

## troubleshooting
If you are having issues connecting after starting your docker container, the first thing you should do is check your docker container logs.
```
podman logs -f wpa_supplicant-udmpro
```

From a recent case I assisted in troubleshooting, the user saw the following in their logs.  The was due to their wpa_supplicant.conf having incorrect paths to the certificates.  Refer to my example in the instructions to ensure yours are pointing to the correct location.
